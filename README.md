# HackerPoulette

## Challenge : 

The company Hackers Poulette â„¢ sells Raspberry Pi accessory kits to build your own.
They want to allow their users to contact their support team.
Your mission is to create a fully-functioning online "contact support" form, in PHP.
It must display a contact form and process the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).

### Instructions

Must have:

- the project repository must include a low-fidelity mock-up
- the form's html code *must* be semantically valid
- the HTML *must be* accessible to blind people
- in case of wrong input, the form should display a useful visual clue about the error
- display the error message near the correct input field
- the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
- the form has to be *sanitised* and *validated* (server side)
- if all required inputs are valid, the script should respond by email to a given address
- implement a [honeypot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) anti spam technique.
